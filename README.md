   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asrivast1/Content-Based-Recommender-System.git
   ```
   
2. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```
   
3. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd Content-Based-Recommender-System
   ```
   
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   
5. In your web browser, a new tab will open with the Jupyter Notebook interface. Locate and open the **content_based_movie_predictor.ipynb** to access the recommender system.
6. Follow the instructions within the notebook to input your movie preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations. Pass your preferred movie as the first argument in get_recommendations method and use cosine_sim2 as second parameter and it'll return the top 10 most similar movies.
